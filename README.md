# JSProject
This is a final project I did for a JavaScript class. 
I created a website with a few simple games to show the different skills I learned in class.
The HTML amd CSS was simple as the main focus of the project was to showcase our JavaScript skills.
I implemented 4 simple games: a Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer, a version of tic-tac-toe against the computer,a guessing game in which the user has to find the location of a few Colorado landmarks on a Google map (using Google Map API), and a simple multiplication game.
For this website, I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
